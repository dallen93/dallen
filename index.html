Hello! This is the index.html file

=======
Spring 2015 GUI Project
D'Marquis Allen

Do you have an important event coming up, but don't know what to wear? What about a casual seasonal gathering that you
refuse to be undressed to again? Do you find yourself spending entirely too much time in the mirror trying to decide 
what to wear?If your answer to these questions are either yes or no, then this is the place for you! 
At our site, users will be able to shop men's dress and casual wear to help them make the perfect statement at their next
formal or casual event. Users will also have the power to "build an ensemble" online, post and share pictures of their latest 
outfits and even post their own how-to videos on everything from neckties, to bowties, to ascotts, and even cartigans!
We guarantee, there's something for everyone at our site.

Still need a site name, will come up with something later.
